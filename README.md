# TIC TAC TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player board game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In this Python project, I have created a program that allows a player to play Tic Tac Toe against the computer. The program will start by displaying the empty 3x3 grid and asking player 1 to enter their move by specifying the number representing each index where they would like to place their symbol. The program will then update the grid to reflect the move and display the updated grid. Then the computer will make it's move, and the process will repeat until one of the players has won or the game ends in a draw.

To create this project,I have used Python's built-in input() function to accept input from the players and the print() function to display the grid and prompt the players for their next move.I have also used looping and conditional statements to control the flow of the game and determine when a player has won or the game has ended in a draw.

## Topics covered in this project are
**#for loop #while loop #lists #classes #inheritance #super class #if else statements #tuple**

## Libraries Used
**# numpy # math # time # string # random**

Overall, this Python project will provide an opportunity for you to practice your programming skills and create a fun and interactive game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
